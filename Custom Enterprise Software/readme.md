># On where operating system development went wrong:
>To begin it makes good sense to focus on Microsoft's Windows operating system. In Redmond a large number of engineers are focused on trying to make the Windows operating system function effectively for the needs of its market of private businesses and government agencies. These organizations typically have large workforces who never want application breaking changes introduced to the operating system. Frequently, it is the case that corporations running Windows for their workforce have paid outside firms sizeable sums of money to develop custom software that is "mission critical" to the company's core business. Companies who make such investments often view the money they've paid for the development of this software in a similar manner to how they would view the investment into any other asset - which is to say that the expectation is that it will continue to function for years. Worse yet is these outside firms often won't exist 10 years after the initial development of the software has been completed, and these same firms often do not offer source code to their customers; hence, their customers end up stuck with old builds. Even in cases where the customer does have source code access enterprise software developers, who are incentivized to complete their scope of work, may have no incentive to write code in a manner that would help future maintainers; they may not even document the code at all.
